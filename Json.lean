JSON for Lean, written to be safe on input it did not choose.

`Json.Spec` transcribes the grammar of RFC 8259. The parser is stated against it, and both
printers are proved to emit nothing it would refuse. Nothing here is `partial` and nothing here
panics, and the parser and the printer both keep their work on the heap, so a document that
nests a million deep is an error or a long string rather than a crash.

Reading is strict by default: a repeated field name is refused, nesting beyond 1024 is refused,
and a significand of more than a thousand digits is refused unread. `Json.Config` relaxes any of
that. `deriving ToJson, FromJson` and the `json%` literal syntax are in the companion package,
which is what keeps the frontend out of a program that only reads and writes JSON.
