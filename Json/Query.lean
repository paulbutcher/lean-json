/-!
Reaching into a value along a path.

Every operation here recurses along the path rather than through the value, so what it costs is
the length of the path, and a deeply nested document is no more dangerous than a flat one.

`set?` adds a field named by the last step of a path, since that is how an object gets built up,
but refuses a missing intermediate rather than inventing one: guessing whether a gap should
become an object or an array is how a typo turns into a new field. `remove?` closes the gap it
leaves in an array, so the index removed is occupied again by its successor.

Where a value sits inside another. Every operation here recurses along the path rather than
through the value, so the depth reached is the length of the path the caller wrote, whatever
the value it is applied to.

/--
`j` with `v` at `p`.

A field named by the last step of the path is added when it is missing, so building an object up
one field at a time works; anything else missing along the way is an error rather than a silent
creation, since guessing whether a gap should become an object or an array is how a typo turns
into a new field.

/-! ## Laws

What the two claims come down to, once the recursion over the path is peeled away, is what a fold
over an object's fields does, which the lemmas in `Json.Basic` say.
