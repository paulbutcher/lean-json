/-!
The grammar names at most one value for a text.

This is a claim about the transcription rather than about the parser: a grammar that derived two
values for one text would make "the value the text denotes" meaningless, and no proof about the
parser could repair it.

The relations are deliberately not deterministic in their remainder, exactly as the ABNF is not:
`12` derives as `1` with `2` left over as readily as it derives as `12`. Two things pin that
down. A value is followed either by the end of the text or by one of the characters that
separates or closes, which is what `Follows` says, and that is enough to make the value unique.
Whitespace is the other: `ws` appears on both sides of every structural character, so two
derivations of the same text can divide one run of spaces differently, and `Json.Spec.Follow`
says that they still reach the same place whenever what comes next is not whitespace.
-/

/-! ## Numbers

A number is where the grammar is genuinely ambiguous about its remainder, so each part of one is
unique only once its remainder is pinned down, which is what `Json.Spec.Follow` supplies: a run
of digits must not be followed by a digit, a fraction not by a point, an exponent not by an `e`.

/-! ## Strings

A string needs no condition on what follows it, because the closing quotation mark is a character
no `Ch` can begin with. The one place two constructors could both apply is a `\u` escape, and
what separates them is that no character carries a surrogate code point: a four-digit escape in
the surrogate range denotes nothing on its own, so only the pair rule can derive it.

/-! ## Values

Two derivations of the same text can divide a run of whitespace differently, so the remainders
they reach need not be equal: `[] ` derives with a space left over or with nothing left over.
What holds is that one remainder is the other with some whitespace taken off, which is `WsEq`,
and that is enough, because the production that follows begins with a character that is not
whitespace and so starts in the same place either way.

/-! ## The value family

`Value`, `Arr`, `Object`, `Elements`, `Members` and `Member` are one mutual definition, which the
`induction` tactic will not take apart. It does not have to: every derivation leaves less text
than it was given, so an induction on the length of the text carries all six, and within one
length they are proved in the order they depend on one another.

Each statement carries what pins its remainder down. A value needs only `Follows`, since what
can come after one is the end of the text or a separator or a closing bracket. A run of elements
or members needs the closing bracket itself, because `1` followed by `,2]` and `1,2` followed by
`]` are both derivations of the same text, and only the bracket tells them apart.

a common starting point first; from there `Follows` holds of both remainders, because a text
